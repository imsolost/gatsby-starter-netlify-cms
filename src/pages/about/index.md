### We create analytics for the software that runs the world
Our mission is to help everyone involved in software engineering create secure and trustworthy code without slowing down.

Combining the fields of databases, programming languages, data science and security we're making the worldâ€™s software truly searchable, so that even deep meaningful questions about security can be answered, helping software organizations better understand their code, engineering processes and people.

### Our People
We believe the sky is the limit when people with different backgrounds and skill sets gather as a team to solve big challenges. Guided by a strong strategic vision, our leadership team is passionately committed to cultivating a strong company culture, unleashing the full potential of every member of the team, and making our customers and open source teams successful in creating more reliable and trustworthy code.
